# 🚀 Revento Ticket Verse
A next-generation event ticketing platform with blockchain integration and immersive user experiences.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Problem Statement 7 – Transform the Future of Rural Commerce

## 🎯 Objective
Revento Ticket Verse solves the problem of secure, transparent, and accessible event ticketing, serving both event organizers and attendees. Our platform leverages blockchain technology for ticket verification, reduces fraud, and creates new opportunities for rural communities to host and promote local events. This platform bridges the gap between urban and rural commerce by making it easy for anyone to organize, discover, and attend events regardless of location.
